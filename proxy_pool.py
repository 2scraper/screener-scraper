proxy_pool.py
--------------
A pool of proxy URLs and the rules for moving between them.

Family core: no site knowledge lives here. Carried over from
farfetch-scraper, with the credential-redaction helper from the newer repos
folded in — see `redact_secret_patterns`.

Why this exists as its own module: `--proxy` was a single static string
applied once at browser launch and never changed. That is the shape of a
demo, not of the thing proxies are bought for — the reason to hold a pool is
to spread a run across exits and to leave an exit that has started getting
challenged.

Kept engine-agnostic and side-effect free (no browser, no network) so the
rotation rules are covered by the offline suite rather than only by a live
run.

**Rotating the IP alone is not enough.** Carrying the same browser session
across two exits is itself a contradiction: cookies a bot manager issued
against IP A, replayed from IP B, are a stronger signal than either address
on its own. So a caller must build a FRESH browser context (new cookie jar,
new storage) for every exit this pool hands out — see playwright_scraper.py,
which tears the browser down and relaunches rather than swapping the proxy
under a live session.
